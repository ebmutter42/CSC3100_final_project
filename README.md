# CSC3100_final_project
Chicken Coop Webpage for CSC 3100 Final

This webpage uses a mixture of HTML, Bootstrap, and JQuery, as well as an API to handle data. 
It was made as a final project for CSC 3100 (Web Development) and is meant to simulate a webpage that "hipster" chicken farmers might want to use.

There is a login page as well as a sign up page, a dashboard to display a few statistics and a graph of temperature and humidity. 
There is a sidebar navigation that can lead you to a settings page, a warnings popup, back to the dashboard, and it gives you the option to log out.
